# Confusion Matrix in Object Detection with TensorFlow

This script generates a confusion matrix using the detections record file generated by the `/object_detection/inference/infer_detections.py` script.

For a full description of the format of the matrix, and how it is computed, take a look at the [Confusion Matrix in Object Detection with TensorFlow](https://www.shiftedup.com/2018/10/10/confusion-matrix-in-object-detection-api-with-tensorflow) article.

To run this script you need a couple of things:

* The label map used by your model — This is the proto-buff file that you created in order to train your model.
  
* A detection record file — This is the file generated by using the `/object_detection/inference/infer_detections.py`. This script runs a TFRecord file through your model and saves the results in a detection record file. 

Here is an example of running the script:

```
python confusion_matrix.py --detections_record=testing_detections.record --label_map=label_map.pbtxt --output_path=confusion_matrix.csv
```

The script will print the confusion matrix along with precision and recall information to the standard output and save the precision/recall results to the specified output area.
